**Scenario:**
Pizza Planet is a popular chain of pizza restaurants known for its wide variety of delicious pizzas. The company has been experiencing steady growth in its existing locations but is now considering expansion into new markets. To support this expansion strategy, Pizza Planet wants to gain deeper insights into its sales data and customer preferences to make informed decisions.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to analyze Pizza Planet's sales data and provide actionable insights to support its expansion strategy. By understanding key metrics such as total orders, revenue, popular pizza types, and distribution patterns, Pizza Planet can identify potential opportunities and challenges in new markets.

**Approach:**
1. **Total Orders and Revenue Analysis:**
   - Calculate the total number of orders placed and the revenue generated from pizza sales to understand the overall performance.
  
2. **Identifying Popular Products:**
   - Determine the highest-priced pizza to understand premium product offerings.
   - Identify the most common pizza size ordered to tailor inventory management and pricing strategies.

3. **Understanding Customer Preferences:**
   - List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities to identify customer favorites.
   - Analyze the distribution of orders by hour of the day to optimize staffing and delivery schedules.

4. **Category-Wise Analysis:**
   - Determine the total quantity of each pizza category ordered to assess product category performance.

5. **Long-Term Analysis:**
   - Calculate the cumulative revenue generated over time to identify trends and seasonality in sales.

**Outcome:**
Based on the insights gained from the analysis, Pizza Planet can develop a targeted expansion strategy. For example:
- If the analysis reveals a high demand for certain pizza types or sizes in specific regions, Pizza Planet can prioritize those products in its new locations.
- Understanding peak ordering hours can help optimize staffing levels and improve customer service.
- Category-wise analysis can inform menu planning and marketing efforts tailored to customer preferences.

By leveraging data-driven insights, Pizza Planet can mitigate risks and maximize opportunities as it expands into new markets, ensuring continued success and growth for the brand.
